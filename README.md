# Project2-MixDesign
###This coding project replicates the current NDOT Mix design model that uses a excel workflow and inputs it into a new python based system. This code takes in User Inputs for various Weights, Percent, Ratios, and Specific Gravitys and displays the calculated final mix design in a clean and easy to read OutPut. Updating this flawed system will allow a transparent and repeatable, and allows for the code to be implemented into a future web based service.

# Features
### -Uses custom functions to translate excel logic and calculations into the python language
### -Utilizes input functions to gather user inputs for a repeatable model
### -Uses basic addition, subtraction, and multiplication for ease of communication and translation
### - Generates a a clean output table replicating the excel workbook exactly

# Resources needed
### -Python
### -Pandas and Numpy libraries
### Jupyter Notebook
### Old Mix Design model for verification

# How to Use
### 1.Make Sure all Coding Resources are installed into the Enviroment
### 2.Run each coding Block in Order
### 3. When asked for inputs, add your various weights, percentages, and ratios
### 4. Verify Mix Design is Correctly displayed
### 5. Re Run the coding block requiring inputs to run various different calculations.
